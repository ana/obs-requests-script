# obs-requests-script

This is a Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script to provide a more usable view of OBS submit requests (SRs).

It's a quick and dirty solution meant to avoid blocking my day-to-day work. Some changes may not be useful for everyone, but they should be easy to modify or comment out.

I'm not planning to invest much more time in this script, as I plan to move to another solution  but pull requests are welcome!
